networking script 
------------------


The script allows you to: 

1. Display the current network configuration.
2. Restart the networking service.
3. Flush the IP address from the interface.
4. Set a static IP address on the interface.
5. Change MAC address of interface.



How to use the script: 

1. Make the script executable : chmod +x networking.sh
2. Run the script : ./networking.sh



Notes: 
This script uses the IP command.
This script assumes you have root privileges.
The changes you do on the script are temporary and will not be persistent after reboot. 
To make a permanent change you need to edit the working configuration file located at /etc/network/interfaces.


 #!/bin/bash = this line tells the system that the script should be executed using the bash shell.


 This script defines four functions to handle different networking tasks. 
 Functions are reusable blocks of code that do specific tasks.


	show_network_config = this function displays the current network configuration.
	ip addr show: shows the IP addresses assigned to all network interfaces.
	ip route show: Displays the routing table, which shows how traffic is routed.


	restart_networking = This function restarts the networking services.
	sudo systemctl restart networking: Restarts the networking services using systemctl. 
	This is useful if you've made changes to the network configuration and need to apply them.

	
	flush_ip = This function removes all IP addresses from a specific network interface.
	ip link show: Lists all network interfaces.
	grep -E `^[0-9]+:` : filters the output to show only the interface names.
	awk -F: `{print $2}` : extracts the interface name from the output.
	read -p: Prompts the user to enter information.
	sudo ip addr flush dev $interface: Removes all IP addresses from the interface.

	
	set_static_ip = This function assigns a static IP address to a network interface.
	ip link show: Lists all network interfaces.
	read -p: Prompts the user to enter information like IP address and netmask of the interface.
	sudo ip addr add $ip_address/$netmask dev $interface: assigns the IP address and netmask to the interface.
	sudo ip route add default via $gateway: sets the default gateway for the interface.


	change_mac = This function allows you to change the MAC address of a network interface.
	List interfaces: it lists all available network interfaces using ip link show.
	User input: It prompts the user to enter the interface name and the new MAC address.
	Change MAC address: 
	sudo ip link set dev $interface down: Brings down the interface (disabling it).
	sudo ip link set dev $interface address $new_mac: Sets the new MAC address.
	sudo ip link set dev $interface up: Brings the interface back up (enabling it).
	confirmation: It confirms that the MAC address has been changed.



	main menu = this script using a while loop to display a menu and handle user input.
	the while true loop keeps the script running until the user chooses to exit.
	the echo commands give a line break and display the menu options.
	read -p: Prompts the user to choose an option.
	case $choice in: Handles the users numbered choice.
